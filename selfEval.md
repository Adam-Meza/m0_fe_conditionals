# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

I feel generally confident in my fluency with the comparison operators. Boolean values, Numbers and Strings are straight forward so making quantitative comparisions with them is easy.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

 I feel good here. 

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

I'm alright in this area. Index numbers can make these confusing for me. Luckily the `.length` method makes that a lot easier to deal them.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

I read for about 2-3 hours. I went over it a few times and watched some Youtube videos. Actually coding it took like 30 minutes for all the parts. 

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I want and need to improve my study habits. Despite knowing the material well I've missed one thing on all my assignments. I feel bad about that. It's something I'm gonna work on and improve. I feel like keeping a more well organized planner would help me a lot. So, that's definitely something I wanna work on before starting MOD 1. 

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I wonder about string interlopation. What is the practical difference in writing a code like 

console.log(`${variable} strings`)

vs 

console.log("string", variable)

Is it ONLY a personal prefrence thing or is there some actual change int functionality?
